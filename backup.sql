1216294	DON'T GET CAUGHT! Stealthing like Metal Gear Solid	Over the years I’ve done a few theories on Metal Gear Solid, but my research has never involved real army vehicles, real guns, and REAL BOXES! For this episode I brought in a few friends to learn about Metal Gear Solid and real stealth tactics from a veteran and 12-year U.S. Navy Seal…who basically thinks we’re a bunch of gamer pansies. In our challenge we’ll find out just how stealthy we really are at trying to sneak into an actual military supply base in the middle of the night…I’ll give you a hint: not very stealthy.\n\nThe 360 video to go along with this episode is a real-world reenactment of a Solid Snake stealth mission and it’s AWESOME.\n\nA HUGE thanks to Odom from the Warpzone, Austin the PeanutButter Gamer, and Katie Wilson for stealthing through this episode with me!

In this episode, we test out the real game mechanics of Five Nights At Candy’s, then learn all about fear responses and why different people respond to these games differently. Our expert for the episode designs some of the most terrifying haunted houses in the world and shows us what it really means to dive into scary games. The 360 video for this episode is also an INCREDIBLY creepy first-person walk through FNAC alone…in the dark…with some unexpected friends… http://bit.ly/28YFQ2o\n\nA HUGE thanks to Vernon from Hot Pepper Gaming/The Game Grumps, Trisha Hershberger of @thatgirltrish, and Rob Dyke from TheRobDyke show for gettin’ their creep on for this episode.

And these aren’t cute little chicks we’re talking about—these are gigantic, eight-foot, 40-miles-per-hour racing monsters! I got pecked, stepped-on, and bucked off for an entire day learning how to actually race these birds, then I took on some serious competition in an all out tournament. Learn what it means to “ride an ostrich like a football” and what happens when your bird decides they just don’t feel like finishing the race!

1216297	Are YOU Being HACKED? (Watch Dogs 2)	Ever wonder what it’s like to be a real life hacker? As someone who works online, it’s one of those things I think about all the time. But it turns out, the truth about hacking is WAY scarier than I could have ever imagined. You know that insane hacking you see in Watch_Dogs and all the bizarre things you can hack like phones, cars, and stoplights? It’s all real, my friends, and it’s just the beginning! For this episode, we brought in two professional hackers to teach us the ins and outs of hacking into a major media company and grabbing data off of their own servers…FOR REAL. This is serious, scary stuff and it completely changed the way I look at the internet and hacking in real life.

1216298	The Science of Sword Fighting! (For Honor)	For the finale of Game Lab Season 1 I wanted us to go out in style…so I decided to SIEGE MY OWN CASTLE! Or at least, a castle I rented for a day. This was one of the most fun episodes to make in the entire series—I got to learn sword techniques, dress in historic armor and stab the Beard Bros. IN THE FACE! When you think about comparing these games to real life, you think about the weapons and the armor, but you DON’T think about the adrenaline, the fatigue, and the idea of complete strangers running at you with axes. It’s a lot more intense and a lot more dangerous than I ever anticipated! For the 360 video, we staged a castle defense with trained knights and Vikings that literally puts you in the middle of the battle.	66783	8	1216298	77797	2016-07-20

1664288	The Long-Term Personal Impact of Minimalism	Global travel with nothing but a bum bag - Video 5/ The personal effects of travelling without luggage.\n\nIn this episode, I reflect on how minimalism has had a lasting influence on my life. I explore some of the positive and negative implications from living out of a tiny bag.\n\nThroughout my travels, I've learnt that the best way to face any pre-trip concerns is simply to begin. We sometimes pay too much attention to all the minor details which add up and can make us lose sight of our primary objectives. By choosing minimalist travel, we are placing all our focus on just the important things that we really need ...but can minimalism become a distraction in itself?	85618	5	1664288	115808	2018-10-18
1664289	Bum Bag Travel for Women	Global travel with nothing but a bum bag - Video 6/ Ultralight packing differences for men & women.\n\nThis episode is for those who wish to travel ultralight but still feel unable to do so.  I specifically look into the few essentials that women might need, beyond the basics I carry in my bum bag.\n\nAcknowledging prevalent gender distinctions, the video suggests some minimalist packing tips for those that might depend on more.  My intention is to show how travel without luggage can still be accessible for all.\n\nFor this episode, I have a little help from my girlfriend, Talise. I tried to make her think differently and I hope it can encourage you to think a little differently too.\n\nI wanted Talise to consider preparing to leave for a no-luggage adventure. I asked her to share the minimum she could leave with, beyond the items I carry.\n\nThese are her key minimalist essentials, the crucial extra items she couldn’t go without.	85618	6	1664289	115808	2018-11-20
1681872	Steps to Becoming a Minimalist Traveller	Global travel with nothing but a bum bag - Video 7/ The barriers before travelling without a backpack.\n\nWhen undertaking a minimalist transformation there are personal, physical and mental challenges to confront before leaving with almost no luggage.\n\nFor this episode, I wanted to consider how others could start to approach a no-baggage trip. I looked at my girlfriends perspective to packing and asked her whether she could leave with less. I was curious if she could ever imagine taking a no-luggage trip and if so, what would be her notable barriers to overcome.\n\nCan I convince my girlfriend to travel without luggage?  Talise knows too well not to pack too much, she knows how to carry almost nothing, however, she still chooses a lot to pack.  This video shares more of her packing story, which involves some heavy struggles along the way.\n\nMinimising my baggage, transformed the way I experience the world. I love ultralight adventures, but traveling with one small bag whilst in a relationship uncovers a striking polarity.\n\nTravel is personal, therefor only you can decide how much is necessary. By sharing my thinking behind why I travel the way I do, I hope this series helps those wanting to take their next step in ultralight travel.\n\nThe main obstacle to travelling light can be helping carry other peoples bags.	85618	7	1681872	115808	2019-01-22

168230	State of Decay, Part Three	The Doctor finds archive material in the TARDIS that tells him he's dealing with an ancient enemy of the Time Lords, a nearly indestructible king vampire who's ready to revive and reenter normal space, spreading death, once again, across the universe.	121	15	168230	6986	1980-12-06

168234	Warriors' Gate, Part Two	Three humorless men from a damaged bulk freighter find the TARDIS. Wearily, Romana returns with them to appraise the situation of their damaged ship but, because she's a time sensitive, winds up as a living navigational component to replace their time-sensitive Tharil (lion-man) who escaped.

168238	Warriors' Gate, Part Four	The Doctor deduces that the freighter is a slave ship loaded up with Tharils to be sold as time machine components, but the immense weight of Rorvik's damaged ship, designed to contain the Tharils, is now collapsing the fragile void of the micro-universe in which they're all stuck, pulling everything inside ever closer.	121	20	168238	6986	1981-01-24

168298	Earthshock, Part Two	With the Doctor cornered in the underground caves by androids, Adric ventures outside of the TARDIS and manages to destroy one of them.

168340	Time-Flight, Part Three	The Master commandeers the Doctor's TARDIS, leaving the stranded Time Lord time to work out the mystery of the alien sanctum he's been trying to enter.

168341	Time-Flight, Part Four	Incorporating the Xeraphin race into his TARDIS power system, the Master has won, but technical obstacles and a bit of sabotage from friendlies give the Doctor a bargaining chip for the lives of the hijacked and enslaved airline passengers and crews - with maybe, just maybe, some hope for the Xeraphin race as well.	121	26	168341	6987	1982-03-30

168381	Mawdryn Undead, Part Three	Danger and discovery await the Doctor back aboard the alien ship, where a modified piece of Time Lord technology awaits his discovery. The Black Guardian is pleased with the Doctor's return and uses Turlough to awaken the ship's undead inhabitants to lead the Doctor to his death.

168383	Mawdryn Undead, Part Four	Mawdryn and his fellow immortals - stuck in ceaseless cycles of mutation and deterioration - are quite determined on the Doctor sacrificing his future for their sakes, giving him the choice between helping them or stranding Teagan and Nyssa with them on their infinite journey.

168389	Terminus, Part Three	Since the Doctor's party represents neither lazars nor handlers, they're presumed to be investigators, which is enough to spark the disgruntled Valgard into challenging Eirak over leadership of the handlers.

168390	Terminus, Part Four	In attempting to reopen a doorway into the TARDIS, Turlough activates Terminus' automated fuel-jettisoning sequence. The first time this sequence was engaged, it flung its first of two massive loads of unstable fuel into the distant past, producing the Big Bang that created the universe. This second sequence - if the Doctor can't find a way to shut it down - will release a second massive load, the explosion of which will entirely negate the effects of the first. 	121	16	168390	6988	1983-02-23

They race against other Eternals for the grand prize of Enlightenment, by which to grant their deepest wishes. That can't be good for the universe, but how can the Doctor strategize against beings adept at reading his every thought?	121	18	168401	6988	1983-03-02
168402	Enlightenment, Part Three	Turlough's panic puts him aboard a pirate ship where Captain Wrack uses his presence to invite all the other captains over for dinner.

168467	Planet of Fire, Part Three	Sarn prophesy foretells of an outsider who will come to aid the people. It's a role the Master is more than delighted to fill, which finally presents Timanov, the Sarn religious leader, the unbridled support he's sought in his campaign to cull the faithless from among his people. Turlough's secret past, however, is somehow intricately involved in all this, and the reluctance of its disclosure is enough to threaten all friendly ties with the Doctor.	121	17	168467	6989	1984-03-01

168545	The Two Doctors, Part Two	With carnage and decay all about the space station, Doctor No. 6 and Peri continue to avoid the automated defense system trying to kill them, but there's also something alive lurking about with an eye on them as well. Evidence suggests the Time Lords are responsible for all this, but the Doctor refuses to believe it. He may be wrong, and he also fears a pinhole has been poked into the bubble that is the universe, with total and unstoppable annihilation to follow. Far away, Doctor No. 2 is about to be dissected by the Sontarans and the Androgum in order to find the symbiotic nuclei that makes time travel for Time Lords possible.	121	8	168545	6990	1985-02-23
168550	The Two Doctors, Part Three	Closing in on the goal of time travel, the Androgum and Sontarans get set to double-cross each other. With Peri and Jamie alternately in danger of winding up on the bill of fare, the decision is made to genetically transform Doctor No. 2 into an insatiably carnivorous Androgum, which causes Doctor No. 6 to develop a sudden taste for house cats as he races to not let this change become permanent. 	121	9	168550	6990	1985-03-02

168577	Revelation of the Daleks, Part Two	The Davros running Tranquil Repose has only been a figurehead - literally just a head, created and animated by Davros himself. Now, the real Davros wheels forth to face the Doctor, but his own immoral dealings have fostered an uneasy surrounding situation, riddled with treachery, that only a few might escape.	121	13	168577	6990	1985-03-30

168833	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Two (The Mysterious Planet, Episode Two)	The Doctor finds that the subterranean UK Habitat is run by a cloistered robot named Drathro, whom the inhabitants call "The Immortal." Their black light energy converters are destabilizing, unaware that it's the result of two space pirates mucking about on the surface with designs on looting their dwelling.	121	2	168833	6994	1986-09-13
168837	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Three (The Mysterious Planet, Episode Three)	The Doctor escapes to rejoin Peri on the surface but shortly becomes the prisoner of a surface-dwelling tribe called The Free. Ravalox isn't Ravalox after all, but before the Doctor can learn much more an irresistible agent from UK Habitat comes to fetch him back. 	121	3	168837	6994	1986-09-20
168838	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Four (The Mysterious Planet, Episode Four)	All those on Ravolox are in exponentially greater peril than anyone can comprehend. If anything in the entire universe is to survive, it may come down to the Doctor arguing against machine logic over the value of life.	121	4	168838	6994	1986-09-27
955403	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Five (Mindwarp, Episode One)	The Doctor's trial continues.

168841	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Six (Mindwarp, Episode Two)	Having been put through a makeshift truth extractor, the Doctor appears damaged, apt to mimic the personalities of those with whom he has eye contact. He eventually abandons Peri and a gung-ho warrior king in favor of joining in with Sil and Dr. Crozier in the latest of their perverse projects. 	121	6	168841	6994	1986-10-11
168857	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Seven (Mindwarp, Episode Three)	While the Doctor helps Dr. Crozier transfer Lord Kiv's brain into a new host skull, Peri accompanies King Yrcanos as he searches for the Alpha Resistance fighters whom he feels, most certainly, will follow him into glorious battle against the Mentors and the Doctor.	121	7	168857	6994	1986-10-18
168889	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Eight (Mindwarp, Episode Four)	The first transfer is flawed, so Dr. Crozier needs to transfer Lord Kiv into another host body. Unfortunately, Peri meets all the requirements for the subsequent candidate. Since the Doctor's been helpful and has somewhat of a personal interest in Peri, he's permitted to locate an equally suitable substitute candidate, if he can. The prosecution rests. 	121	8	168889	6994	1986-10-25
168902	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Nine (Terror of the Vervoids, Episode One)	With the prosecution case concluded, the Doctor begins his defence, an adventure from his own future.

168862	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Eleven (Terror of the Vervoids, Episode Three)	A course change that takes the Hyperion III closer to a black hole could prove unwise when there are so many aboard ship with hidden agendas. Disappearances continue, a murderer remains at large, and one person finally crumbles under the strain of harboring a guilty secret. 	121	11	168862	6994	1986-11-15
168883	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Twelve (Terror of the Vervoids, Episode Four)	With factions vying for control of the ship, the Vervoids are found to be responsible for the many disappearances. Only the Doctor sees the fundamental but missed point as to why they can't be reasoned with or why they can't be allowed to arrive on Earth. 	121	12	168883	6994	1986-11-22
168894	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Thirteen (The Ultimate Foe, Episode One)	With the Doctor now reluctantly admitting to genocide, things look bad. But the Doctor's nemesis, the Master, intervenes, and the real truth behind the trial comes to light - and with it, the shocking secret of the Valeyard's true identity...	121	13	168894	6994	1986-11-29
168897	The Trial of a Time Lord, Part Fourteen (The Ultimate Foe, Episode Two)	So much ado by the Valeyard and the Master over the Doctor's death makes the Doctor wary of being made decoy for some other, truer target. Continuing in the Matrix itself, he may find both them and the answers he seeks. 	121	14	168897	6994	1986-12-06
168581	Time and the Rani, Part One	The alien world of Lakertya. With the aid of the savage Tetraps, the Rani has conquered this planet to allow her to continue her depraved biochemical experiments. But she finds herself needing the Doctor's assistance...	121	1	168581	6991	1987-09-07
168598	Time and the Rani, Part Two	The Rani's deviousness inadvertently sets the Doctor and Mel against each other - she having yet seen the Doctor in his new regeneration, he believing Mel is the Rani disguised, and each thinking the other is an agent of utmost evil to be brought down. Two unanswered questions linger: Why has the Rani collected geniuses, and why is she messing around with "strange matter."	121	2	168598	6991	1987-09-14
168601	Time and the Rani, Part Three	The solstice nears, making it time for the Rani to bring her plans into fruition. The Doctor's sympathies for Beyus, ruler of the Lykertyans, are rather qualified. Beyus' heart is for his people yet something prompts him to collaborate fully in helping the Rani reach all her objectives. The answer, he's told, lies within the Center of Leisure. 	121	3	168601	6991	1987-09-21
168604	Time and the Rani, Part Four	The Rani, at last, links the Doctor into her great brain machine, the crowning jewel in her component packet of geniuses brought together to turn Lakertya itself into one vast cerebral mass capable of redirecting time anywhere in the universe, giving her absolute power over all creation. 	121	4	168604	6991	1987-09-28
975911	Paradise Towers, Part One	The Doctor and Mel visit Paradise Towers, a apartment complex in the 21st century, only to find it rat-infested and ruined. Paradise Towers is inhabited by Rezzies (elderly women, at least some of whom are cannibals), Kangs (roving gangs of teenage girls), Pex (a cowardly young warrior who proclaims himself the local hero) and Caretakers led by a Chief whose job is to keep the apartment complex in order. But the Doctor and Mel find that robotic cleaners are killing off everyone in Paradise Towers, one-by-one. The culprit is Kroagnon, the building's award-winning architect, who plots to rid Paradise Towers of all those who live within it.	121	5	975911	6991	1987-10-05
168628	Paradise Towers, Part Two	The Doctor reunites with the Red Kangs to question why no one questions the steady number of deaths at Paradise Towers. Elsewhere, Mel meets the Blue Kangs who reveal that Pex, the lone young male in the complex (who talks a good game while flanking Mel), is not nearly the heroic and capable fighter he continually boasts of being. 	121	6	168628	6991	1987-10-12
168629	Paradise Towers, Part Three	The Doctor discovers that Paradise Towers' great architect, Kroagnon, was also responsible for Miracle City, an infamous killer habitat. Though chance circumstances permit Mel to avoid a dinner date with a couple of grandmotherly cannibals, the Doctor realizes everyone must band together or be destined for the menu of a greater infamy lurking in the basement. 	121	7	168629	6991	1987-10-19
168630	Paradise Towers, Part Four	Meeting up at the pool, the Doctor leads the surviving Rezzies, Kangs and Caretakers as they draw the line together on the 245th floor against the systematic cleansing of all life by Kroagnon and his robotic Cleaners. 	121	8	168630	6991	1987-10-26
168631	Delta and the Bannermen, Part One	Wales, 1959. A top-secret US satellite has mysteriously gone missing. This could have something to do with the arrival of a party of alien tourists en route to Disneyland, amongst their number Mel and the Doctor, and the Queen of the Chimerons - who's fleeing the Bannermen and their genocidal leader Gavrok...	121	9	168631	6991	1987-11-02

168684	Remembrance of the Daleks, Part Two	With two factions of Daleks involved in a race war on Earth, the Doctor takes care of old business by having the Hand of Omega ceremoniously but quietly buried in a churchyard. His actions do not go unobserved, and leaving behind a bored Ace without a purposeful outlet could spell trouble as well. 	121	2	168684	6992	1988-10-12
168685	Remembrance of the Daleks, Part Three	The Doctor plans to let one of the Dalek factions have the Hand of Omega (but not too easily, of course) while keeping Gilmore and his military men preoccupied in a safe territory, but that plan could be threatened by a mole in their midst and a miscalculation on the Doctor's part. 	121	3	168685	6992	1988-10-19

Now with the Hand of Omega, the Imperial Daleks expect to rule over both time and the Time Lords.

1277274	The Libido	When we talk about libido, it?s often described as an impulse linked to our hormones. But how does it really work? Lili meets with Normand Voyer, a professor of organic chemistry at Laval University, to concoct a love potion. What is the connection between our thoughts and what happens physically when it comes to sex and desire? A psychotherapist guides us towards the answer to this question, as Lily gently explores the world of sex addicts, asexuals, and the polyamorous.	70460	1	1277274	85568	2016-01-22
1785977	The Orgasm	When it comes to the orgasm, we know it feels good as soon as we have one. But we can?t explain why it feels so good. In this episode, Lili meets with a renowned professor of neuroscience and psychology at Concordia University, who has been studying this subject for years with lab rats. She also works with a sex coach to find the G-spot, and meets with a tantric sex teacher and her students.	70460	2	1785977	85568	2016-01-29
1785978	Masturbation	Masturbation has many benefits. It reduces stress, promotes sleep, and calms migraines and menstrual pain. Masturbation stimulates the heart rate as much as a brisk walk. Lili meets with three Montreal girls who are exploring masturbation with their website and magazine devoted to the subject, Magic Caresses. Everybody does it, but the where and the how are unique to everyone - and Lili helps reveal the mystery.	70460	3	1785978	85568	2016-02-05
1785979	The Vulva	The vulva has a way of making people uncomfortable. Just saying the word makes some people uncomfortable. We can talk about breasts and the vagina no problem, so what is it about the vulva? Lili explores the vulva in all its glory by making an appointment with her gynaecologist. What better way to interview than lying on a doctor?s table? She also meets with a transsexual to talk about vaginoplasty, and with a porn actress to better understand the phenomenon of female ejaculation.	70460	4	1785979	85568	2016-02-12

1785980	Fetishism	Is fetishism a sexual perversion? Are we all a little fetishist to some degree or another? In this episode, we take you by the hand and immerse you in this little-known universe laced with misconceptions. Lili meets with neuropsychologist Christian Joyal, who conducted a study on the subject for the prestigious Journal of Sexual Medicine. To test the theory, Lili visits a daycare for adults, observes rats dressed in tiny lab coats, and meets with a couple that likes to play with ropes. Don’t worry; it’s all done with love!	70460	5	1785980	85568	2016-02-19
1785981	The Penis	Is there such a thing as the perfect penis? Lili launches her investigation by meeting with biologists to talk about the penis in mammals and insects. Penis size and performance are common obsessions among men. We talk about the Quebec porn actor with the biggest penis in the sex industry. And to complete her tour of man’s most precious organ, Lili meets with a pro-foreskin activist.	70460	6	1785981	85568	2016-02-26
1785982	The Ass	Has the butt become the new sexual Mecca? With more and more people enhancing their derrieres, (thank you, Kim Kardashian!), the ass has become society’s number one sexual asset. Among the most popular plastic surgeries of our time, the famous Brazilian butt lift is now practiced well beyond the borders of Latin America. And how about those belfies (a.k.a. butt selfies) that get hundreds of thousands of hits on social media? As she explores the growing craze for this popular part of our anatomy, Lili also meets with therapist and speaker Carlyle Jansen to demystify the practice of anal sex, considers the risks of sodomy with gastroenterologist Michael Bensoussan, and debunks the myth that all homosexuals are into anal.	70460	1	1785982	123863	2017-01-27
1785983	STDs	In the age of social media and online hook-ups, are STDs making a comeback? There’s been an upsurge in cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis in recent times. Lili tackles the problem with sexologist Sarah-Mathieu Chartier, co-author of the most recent study on the sexual health of young people in Quebec. And what does it mean to live with an STD today? Guy Leduc, founder of the website ITSRencontres.com, who himself has contracted herpes, weighs in. We can all agree that more needs to be done to spread the STD message, and that we need to reinvent our preventative strategies. Could mobile apps and video games be the answer in 2016?	70460	2	1785983	123863	2017-02-03
1785984	Breasts	Are breasts synonymous with sex? Have they always played such an important role in our culture? Lili meets with historian Evelyne Ferron, a specialist in the history of breasts throughout the ages. She also talks to 23-year-pld Instagram sensation Kristyna Martelli, who boasts a 32JJ cup size (the result of six surgeries) and makes a living from her ample bosom. Never one to shy away from misconceptions, Lili takes the opportunity to explore the bra … how many women will she convince to take theirs off?	70460	3	1785984	123863	2017-02-10
1785985	Performance	According to a recent study, sexual performance is one of the biggest concerns among us. But most of the time, these worries are unfounded, based on a completely biased view of what a “normal” sexual relationship should be. Lili takes stock of the myths and facts surrounding sexual performance.	70460	4	1785985	123863	2017-02-17
1785986	Masculine Pleasure	Do men exploit the full sexual potential of their bodies? Beyond the precious penis, are they aware that there is more than one path that leads to orgasm? Lili invites men to discover their bodies by introducing them to sex toys for men and their multiple erogenous zones, the P-spot and the mysterious prostatic orgasm. She explores the subject with sexologist Vincent Quesnel, sexual therapist Carlyle Jansen, and David Francis-Cassidy, founder of Montreal’s Temple Priapus.	70460	5	1785986	123863	2017-02-24
1785987	Domination	Is the act of sex another power game brought to the bedroom? Is there always one dominant partner in the relationship? And when a couple voluntarily introduces power games into the bedroom, is it possible to explore aggression without abuse? Lili seeks answers to these questions with, among others, well-known psychologist Meredith Chivers, neuropsychologist Christian Joyal, sexology researcher and author of the BDSM book The Rules of the Game, Jessica Caruso, and a professional dominatrix. Sexual domination: healthy fun or a dangerous game?	70460	6	1785987	123863	2017-03-03
1785988	Menopause | Andropause	Is it possible to have a sex life after menopause and andropause? Menopause has been well documented for years. But what about andropause, the inevitable loss of libido that occurs after the age of 50, which we’ve only been talking about for the past 15 years? Can it be treated or is it a natural part of aging that we must learn to live with? Lili explores these questions with andropause specialist Luc Bessette. She also talks to Laurie Betito, psychologist, radio host and author of The Sex Bible for people over 50, and Valérie Gibson, the world’s first “cougar” and the official guide for women stepping out with younger men.	70460	7	1785988	123863	2017-03-10
1785989	Porn	While porn is everywhere today, consumed frequently as a cultural product, is it still shameful to talk about? Lili explores the world of pornography without taboos, exploring its effects on the body and the mind with Eric Falardeau, a doctoral student in pornographic studies. She also talks with Magik, producer and designer of immersive porn, neuroscientist Jim Pfaus, and Mélody Kush, a popular Quebec webcam girl. Beyond the few minutes of pleasure it promises, is porn harmful or beneficial?	70460	8	1785989	123863	2017-03-17
1785990	Abstinence	Where there is sex, there is inevitably the absence of it. Lili explores all things abstinence: what motivates it, the effects in can have on the body (blue balls, blue bean), the social and cultural pressures associated with it (hymen reconstruction), and puts it to the test herself. After a month of total abstinence, she shares her reflections.	70460	9	1785990	123863	2017-03-24
1785991	Bisexuality	Is bisexuality just a matter of opportunism? Do we all have a little bisexual in us? Is our sexual orientation genetic? Lili unravels the answers with the help of psychologist Meredith Chivers, who has explored the question “Are women naturally bisexual?” and meets with sexologist and researcher Jessica Caruse, who has been thinking about the distinction between sexual orientation and social trends.	70460	10	1785991	123863	2017-03-31
1785992	The Mouth	The mouth fulfills many functions, some of which are vital to our existence, but it is also used for kissing and making love. Lili meets with doctor Tareck Ayad to understand this complex organ. She continues her quest for knowledge with French writer and essayist Alexandre Lacroix, who shares his views on kissing, and with Nicholas Charbonneaux, actor and stage director, who helps Lili as she tries to discover her sexy voice.	70460	1	1785992	123864	2018-02-02
1785993	Monogamy	Is it today’s culture that makes monogamy such a difficult concept? Or is monogamy simply a social experiment gone wrong?

When undertaking a minimalist transformation there are personal, physical and mental challenges to confront before leaving with almost no luggage.

For this episode, I wanted to consider how others could start to approach a no-baggage trip. I looked at my girlfriends perspective to packing and asked her whether she could leave with less. I was curious if she could ever imagine taking a no-luggage trip and if so, what would be her notable barriers to overcome.

Can I convince my girlfriend to travel without luggage?  Talise knows too well not to pack too much, she knows how to carry almost nothing, however, she still chooses a lot to pack.  This video shares more of her packing story, which involves some heavy struggles along the way.

Minimising my baggage, transformed the way I experience the world. I love ultralight adventures, but traveling with one small bag whilst in a relationship uncovers a striking polarity.

Travel is personal, therefor only you can decide how much is necessary. By sharing my thinking behind why I travel the way I do, I hope this series helps those wanting to take their next step in ultralight travel.
